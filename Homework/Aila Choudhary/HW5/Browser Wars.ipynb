By 2001, Internet Explorer was the clear winner, but it was not long before the Second Browser Wars began (2004-2017). This coincided with the rise of smartphones, which emphasized the need and competitiveness for more mobile-friendly versions of browsers. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>In this notebook, we'll analyze the worldwide popularity of browsers over time using Google Trends. Although this won't give us direct market share figures, we can use Google Trends to get a sense of interest of a given browser over time and how that interest compares to other browsers. In particular, we will be looking at five major players over the past two decades: Mozilla Firefox (2002-), Apple's Safari (2002-), Google Chrome (2008-), Microsoft Internet Explorer (1995-2020), and Opera (1995-).</p>\n<p>The dataset you will use was downloaded as a CSV from this <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F01dyhm,%2Fm%2F0168s_,%2Fm%2F04j7cyf,%2Fm%2F03xw0,%2Fm%2F01z7gs\">Google Trends query</a> in mid-October of 2020.
