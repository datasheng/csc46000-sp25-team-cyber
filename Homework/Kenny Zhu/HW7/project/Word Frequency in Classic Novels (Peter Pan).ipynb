Did you know that although the play was titled \"Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\", J. M. Barrie's novel was actually titled \"Peter and Wendy\"? </p>\n<p>You're going to explore and analyze Peter Pan's text to answer the question in the instruction pane below. You are working with the text version available here at <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm\">Project Gutenberg</a>. Feel free to add as many cells as necessary. Finally, remember that you are only tested on your answer, not on the methods you use to arrive at the answer!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't completed a DataCamp project before you should check out the <a href=\"https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/33\">Intro to Projects</a> first to learn about the interface. <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-importing-data-in-python\">Intermediate Importing Data in Python</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing-in-python\">Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python</a> teach the skills required to complete this project. Should you decide to use them, English stopwords have been downloaded from <code>nltk</code> and are available for you in your environment.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use this cell to begin your analysis, and add as many as you would like!\n\n# Importing requests, BeautifulSoup, nltk, and Counter\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport nltk\nfrom collections import Counter","execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Getting the Peter Pan HTML\nr = requests.get('https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm')\n\n# Setting the correct text encoding of the HTML page\nr.encoding = 'utf-8'\n\n# Extracting the HTML from the request object\nhtml = r.text","execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n\n# Getting the text out of the soup\ntext = soup.get_text()","execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a tokenizer\ntokenizer = nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer(r'\\w+')\n\n# Tokenizing the text\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\n\n# Create a list called words containing all tokens transformed to lower-case\nwords = [word.lower() for word in tokens]","execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Getting the English stop words from nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nsw = stopwords.words('english')","execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a list words_ns containing all words that are in words but not in sw\nwords_ns = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in sw]","execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize a Counter object from our processed list of words\ncount = Counter(words_ns)\n\n# Store 10 most common words and their counts as top_ten\ntop_ten = count.most_common(10)\n\n# Print the top ten words and their counts\nprint(top_ten)","execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"[('peter', 409), ('wendy', 362), ('said', 358), ('would', 217), ('one', 212), ('hook', 174), ('could', 142), ('cried', 136), ('john', 133), ('time', 126)]\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Character names in the top ten most common meaningful words in the text\nprotagonists = ['peter', 'wendy', 'hook', 'john']","execution_count":16,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
